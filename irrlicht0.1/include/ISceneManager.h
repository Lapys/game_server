	different Camera scene nodes (addCameraSceneNode(), addCameraSceneNodeMaya()),
	scene nodes for Light (addLightSceneNode()), Billboards (addBillboardSceneNode())
	and so on.
	A scene node is a node in the hirachical scene graph. Every scene node may have children,
	which are other scene nodes. Children move relative the their parents position. If the parent of a node is not
	visible, its children won't be visible too. In this way, it is for example easily possible
	to attach a light to a moving car, or to place a walking character on a moving platform
	on a moving ship.
